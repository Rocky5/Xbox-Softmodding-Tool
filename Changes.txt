	Xbox Softmodding Tool v1.1.7
	Created by Rocky5
=========================================

=========================================
	Update: December 1 2020
=========================================
		Extras Disc should now detect retail bios properly.
		( no more crashing )
		Backup Bios in NKPatcher settings will dump proper sized bios.
		( no more 1MB bios for v1.6 xbox for example )
		Added a new app Dashloader Customizer so you can set your custom face button launch paths easily.
		Fixed dashloader not working with the start and back buttons
		( face button launching, forgot they ain't analogue buttons )


=========================================
	Update: December 30 2019
=========================================
		Updated Dashloader to support multiple dash configs via pressing face buttons.
		( A,B,X,Y,Start,Back,White and black configs are located in E:/UDATA/21585554/000000000000/nkpatcher settings/dashloader/ )
		Updated Dashloader to store its files on E so people can change stuff and add custom boot paths eg...
		Added a TSOP flasher feature to the extras disc.
		( Hold Start or run it from the menu under the tools menu )
		Updated the disc to allow users to install apps eg... if hardmodded.
		Note: this update has been sitting here for the better part of a year, so I have probably forgot some things :lol:

=========================================
	Update: March 23 2019
=========================================
		Added the option to remove parental controls to the EEPROM options in NKPatcher Settings.
		Fixed backing up the eeprom from NKPatcher settings.


=========================================
	Update: March 22 2019
=========================================
		Added the option to Backup the Xbox BIOS to the Kernel options in NKPatcher Settings.
		( E:\Backups\BIOS is where the bios is dumped to )


=========================================
	Update: March 18 2019
=========================================
		Updated the Extras Disc to detect my softmod, other softmods or a hardmodded system.
		( this should fix folk softmodding hardmodded systems, this can also be used for other discs like hexen eg... )
		Changed how dual booting is done, its disabled by default but had to be changed due to how I do the NKPatcher patching on the xbox.
		( a rework of some stuff in the Xbox Softmodding Tool Kit tool, also fixed the language set text showing when it shouldn't. )
		Enabled Force VGA in the Video modes menu in NKPatcher Settings.
		I now update the dashboard config.xml and skin files when updating the softmod.
		( only if the files exist, so no more 1.1.5 when in fact its v1.1.6 eg... )
		Updated the ernie font to patch the time to 2019
		New .bat file for building the Extras Disc straight to a application format.
		( you just FTP over the "Xbox Softmodding Tool Extras Disc" to your applications/apps folder. )
		
		
		NOTE:
			The above Dual Boot change will fix any issues where the DVD drive is finicky or the IDE cable is on its way out.
			If you enable Dual Booting and have boot issues fix the DVD drive, IDE cable or disable it.


=========================================
	Update: February 03 2019
=========================================
		Change to how the Softmod is installed to the HDD from the extras disc to help combat corruption or bad disc reading.
		Added the option to set the system language for the whole system to NKPatcher Settings.
		( means you don't need the MSDash any more to do it )
		Small update to address C partitions with less than 500MB of space.
		( This would normally cause the Fix softmod loop, so now if there isn't enough space it will make a smaller shadowc.img file. )
		Added XBMC-Emustation v1.2.015 to the extras disc.
		Updated XBMC4Gamers to the latest build.
		Dashloader updated with xInput. So now you can hold Start+Y to enter a recovery dashboard if you corrupt or damage the dashboard xbe file.
		( you can also create a custom "same name as xbe".rec file with a custom recovery dash path. )
		Version change to v1.1.5


=========================================
	Update: January 17 2018
=========================================
		Quick update, still same version.
		Updated XBMC4Gamers to the latest build.
		Added 9 new dashboard locations. ( if you installed this before this date, just run the updater and you will get the changes )
			C:\XBMC-Emustation\default.xbe
			E:\XBMC-Emustation\default.xbe
			F:\XBMC-Emustation\default.xbe
			C:\XBMC4Gamers\default.xbe
			E:\XBMC4Gamers\default.xbe
			F:\XBMC4Gamers\default.xbe

=========================================
	Update: January 07 2018
=========================================
		Updated XBMC4Gamers to the latest revision.
		Fixed a type in the NKPatcher Settings menu.
		I don't install the persistent softmod during the softmod, you can enable it via NKPatcher Setting if you want that extra layer of protection.
		I don't install the systems kernel font during the softmod process, again like above you can enable it manually if you want.


=========================================
	Update: October 09 2017
=========================================
		Patched UnleashX Build 584 to work with all FTP programs.
		( That includes all UX xbe files I use through out the hole package )
		Updated the UnleashX dash on the extras disc with the fix.
		The "Xbox Softmod Tool kit" now keeps your original eeprom.bin when you run the HDD Key Nuller.
		( eeprom_original.bin )


=========================================
	Update: September 27 2017
=========================================
		Changed the Upgrade and Update softmod options on the extras disc to only use the E:\Prep directory.
		( moving it back to here as I have a pop up that states you need a minimum of 30MB on E )
		Changed how the 5960 modded dashboard works, if persistent softmod is disabled it will show the language menu and if its enable it will hide it.
		Removed the rar compression from best to default. ( this may fix the rare case of it failing to extract )
		

=========================================
	Update: September 09 2017
=========================================
		Stopped the softmod setting the time to GMT
		Fixed readme typo
		

=========================================
	Update: July ** 2017
=========================================
		Fixed the Extras Disc crashing if you press Up on one of the dashboards sub menus
		Added User Interface X Dash to the extras disc
		Now install the systems correct kernel font when softmodding the system
		( this is due to the persistent softmod, if the generic one is installed it will hang the system if you cold boot an original game and press eject )
		Updated the kernel update code, now will tell you if its installing the generic font
		( if no compatible kernel is found )
		Updated the TH4 saves, you now have 3 versions. NTSC, PAL and Region Free
		Changed the Quick Update/Upgrade layout, you now just place the Update or Upgrade folder in E and Softreset.
		( Dashloader was updated to work with these layouts )
		Added the option to disable or enable "Persistent Softmod" mode to the new Advanced features menu in the EEPROM menu.		
		Added a modded 5960 dashboard to the extras disc.
		( This is what's installed when you select 5960, the retail version is only used for the restore feature of the extras disc )		
		"Xbox Softmod Tool Kit" now has a visual GUI, so you know what's happening.		
		Extras Disc layout change, since I will be added emulators to the disc.		
		Reorganised the source layout, cleaner and more organised.
		Changed all the .enabled files to .bin files, just sounds cleaner.		
		Updated the C Rescuedash config.xml		
		Simplified the "XBHDM Build" variant.		
		Removed the PBL from the rescuedash in the real c partition, its not needed.		
		Added Configmagic v1.6.1
		( This has the fixed CRC and a other changes & additions )		
		Fixed Configmagics CRC checksum calculator.
		( Wasn't an issue for versions under 1.6 this is why when updating the eeprom on a v1.6+ Xbox it would revert all settings )		
		Added support for "Xbox Softmodding Tool Kit" to revert the eeprom to a factory state, dump eeprom.bin in a decrypted state, write VideoFlags, AudioFlags, Language, TimeZoneStdname, TimeZoneDltname, TimeZoneStddate, TimeZoneDltdate and TimeZoneDltBias values to the EEPROM.		
		Added Video region changing to the new Advanced features menu for the EEPROM menu.
		( Switch between NTSC or PAL )		
		Slight redesign of the Extras Disc skin, now shows available space for E, F & G partitions.
		( Compiled as release instead of debug )		
		I now patch NKPatcher on the xbox for different partition types, this saves some space on C.		
		Updated "Xbox Softmod Tool Kit" to take some of the burden for copying files to places on the HDD during the softmod.
		( Makes the install faster )		
		Added a messagebox to the "Update/Upgrade/Restore" function of the Extras disc about having a minimum of 30MB of free space on E.
		( Hopefully people will realise you need space on E first, as there is no way to check if running from disc )		
		"Xbox Softmod Tool Kit" code optimisation and cleaning.		
		Added Null HDD Key to the "NKPatcher Settings > EEPROM > Advanced Features" menu
		( This option will null the Xbox HDD key so you can now always recover or build a new HDD without the eeprom.bin )		
		Updated the "Update/Upgrade" function on the extras disc to use the Y partition for the softmod save files, this saves 7MB of space in case you're low on space on E.		
		Updated the Virtual EEPROM code to now do the CRC for the serial checksum, so now when virtual eeprom is enabled it will have "V-EEPROM ENB" as the serial number.		
		Fixed subnet mask for the static IPs, not sure why they were all 255.255.255.255		
		Added the choice to install older builds of UnleashX to the Extras Disc version of UnleashX
		( install it as a dashboard and you got to Settings > Miscellaneous > Change UX Builds )		
		Slight update to NKPatcher Settings menus.		
		Disabled Virtual EEPROM writing, means you cant arse anything up with you're using it.
		Other back-end changes that improve the functionality of the softmod and user experiences.


=========================================
	Update: June 07 2017
=========================================
		Changed the version to 1.1.1, since there have been a lot of changes since the v1.1 release.

		( Its not enabled, I don't want to add it just yet )

		( Its not enabled, it was going to be used for the "Backup, Restore or Move" system, so you can softreset back to NKPatcher Settings )
		There are other changes, see if you can find them.

=========================================
	Update: Feb 18 2017

		Changed all configs to match the above changes.
		Updated Chimp 261812 to the latest version.
		Updated the UDDAE exploit the use BFM bios as well. ( added CDRom0 ( hex edit ) as a boot path so disc can be launched if inserted )
		I patch NKPatcher Settings unleashx.xbe during the softmod install, to stop it extracting and using titleimage.xbx files.
		( this means you/I don't need transparent icon.png files to hide the titleimage.xbx file from showing in the top right )
		Added the habibi signatures for the edited xbe files when patching them during the softmod.
		( you would get error 21 if they aren't habibi signed, so loading the save file would error 21 )

=========================================
	Update: Jan 4 2017
=========================================
		Updated the installation process, I now put the "2016 Softmod Tool Kit" into the Prep folder and reboot after the softmod is installed.
		( This fixes any issues if someone ejects the disc at the end of the softmod installation. Would have require reinstalling from the recover menu to fix )
		Added "Build 570" directory into UnleashX when installed from the disc, this is so folk don't need to go looking for it when they have Filezilla issues.
		Changed all the static IP's to 192.168.0.*

=========================================
		Fixed the list high for all the skins.
		Fixed the main skin files (A) Select background being off a little.
		Update to the "2016 Softmod Tool Kit" tool. Now when the Virtual EEPROM is enabled it will now display "V-EEPROM ENB" as the systems serial number.
		Updated the Virtual EEPROM settings menu:
			> You now cannot run the "Enable" option more than once, as the Virtual EEPROM is write protected until disabled and the system had restarted.
			> Disable now has a mandatory restart.
			> You cannot run the "Disable" option if the Virtual EEPROM isn't enabled and visa versa for "Enable".
			> You cannot backup the EEPROM when the Virtual EEPROM is enabled. ( reason: it will read the virtual one instead of the onboard one )
		Forgot to change the "Restore System to Stock" to match the new softmod layout :\
		

=========================================
	Update: Dec 22 2016
=========================================
		Moved to NKPatcher 11.UO5 ( My edit ) for the initial softmod.

		Updated some of the batch files to use the new softmod layout.
		Updated all of the images for the skins, now smaller and look the same.
		Removed the 480p patch I had applied to UnleashX, wasn't working the way it should due to the TV switching to progressive.
		Added to the information button at the top NKPatcher Settings menu how to Exit NKPatcher Settings.
		Removed the videoset.db so now you have to set your screen position yourself.
		Other minor things, getting ready for release! ( Thank god! )

		
=========================================
	Update: Dec 21 2016

=========================================
		Updated the version to v1, as its basically done.
		Added a new variant of the default softmod skin, a wide version!

=========================================

		2)	Changed how the hole softmod is done, I no longer use NKPatcher for disabling the shadowc partition so now you can softreset out of NKPatcher Settings.
			( I modify Unleashx during the softmod )
		3)	I also changed how the ShadowC partition is created, its now created on the fly using the new tool kit above.
		4)	Crap loads of edits, to many to remember :\ lets just say its almost a hole new softmod :D
