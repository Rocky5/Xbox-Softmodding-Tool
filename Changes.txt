=========================================
	Update: Jan 19 2017
=========================================
		Reverted back to stock NKPatcher 11 U04. ( I removed my edits for no virtual eeprom on eject )


=========================================
	Update: Jan 18 2017
=========================================
		Updated the configs and instructions for the variant builds of the softmod.
		Cleaned up the 2016 Softmod Tool Kit source. ( due to changes made prior )
		Added new txt files, Free FTP Programs.txt and How to run the exploit save.txt.

=========================================
	Update: Jan 14 2017
=========================================
		Had to revert to using BFM bios for the softmod install due to v1.0 Xbox being finicky as hell with NKPatcher 11.
		Changed all configs to match the above changes.
		Updated Chimp 261812 to the latest version.
		Updated the UDDAE exploit the use BFM bios as well. ( added CDRom0 ( hex edit ) as a boot path so disc can be launched if inserted )
		I patch NKPatcher Settings unleashx.xbe during the softmod install, to stop it extracting and using titleimage.xbx files.
		( this means you/I don't need transparent icon.png files to hide the titleimage.xbx file from showing in the top right )
		Added the habibi signatures for the edited xbe files when patching them during the softmod.
		( you would get error 21 if they aren't habibi signed, so loading the save file would error 21 )
		Updated dashloader.


=========================================
	Update: Jan 4 2017
=========================================
		Updated the installation process, I now put the "2016 Softmod Tool Kit" into the Prep folder and reboot after the softmod is installed.
		( This fixes any issues if someone ejects the disc at the end of the softmod installation. Would have require reinstalling from the recover menu to fix )
		Added "Build 570" directory into UnleashX when installed from the disc, this is so folk dont need to go looking for it when they have Filezilla issues.
		Changed all the static IP's to 192.168.0.*


=========================================
	Update: Dec 31 2016
=========================================
		Updated Chimp261812, nothing major it wont effect 99% of folk.

		
=========================================
	Update: Dec 23 2016
=========================================
		Fixed the list high for all the skins.
		Fixed the main skin files (A) Select background being off a little.
		Update to the "2016 Softmod Tool Kit" tool. Now when the Virtual EEPROM is enabled it will now display "V-EEPROM ENB" as the systems serial number.
		Updated the Virtual EEPROM settings menu:
			> You now cannot run the "Enable" option more than once, as the Virtual EEPROM is write protected until disabled and the system had restarted.
			> Disable now has a mandatory restart.
			> You cannot run the "Disable" option if the Virtual EEPROM isn't enabled and visa versa for "Enable".
			> You cannot backup the EEPROM when the Virtual EEPROM is enabled. ( reason: it will read the virtual one instead of the onboard one )
		Forgot to change the "Restore System to Stock" to match the new softmod layout :\
		

=========================================
	Update: Dec 22 2016
=========================================
		Moved to NKPatcher 11.UO5 ( My edit ) for the initial softmod.

		Updated some of the batch files to use the new softmod layout.
		Updated all of the images for the skins, now smaller and look the same.
		Removed the 480p patch I had applied to UnleashX, wasn't working the way it should due to the TV switching to progressive.
		Added to the information button at the top NKPatcher Settings menu how to Exit NKPatcher Settings.
		Removed the videoset.db so now you have to set your screen position yourself.
		Other minor things, getting ready for release! ( Thank god! )
